DONE:
- transform JPEGs received from server in '/' into some sort of animation/gif that uses the images as keyframes (preferably in the client side with some trickery, not having to make an actual gif)

- Create some sort of CRON job or job queue or some method to make a POST request to '/burst' or activate burst mode.
	- Save the time that the last set of pictures were taken and display it as well in the main page

	
- Edit code of esp so it checks the ip on github pages again every 5 checks it tries and can't reach the server.

- add delay between status requests; add delay between each pic taken
